<h1>Portfolio for Andy Tuttle</h1>

This project is the main page of [andytuttle.io](http://www.andytuttle.io).

As a student developer at [DigitalCrafts](http://www.digitalcrafts.com), this portfolio is a showcase of most of the major work I have completed in a 16 week immersive full-stack course. As a bootcamp graduate, I plan on focusing my personal development efforts on providing even more content which will eventually be published and available here.

## Technologies Used

- The bulk of this project was completed with React and React-Router using ES-6+ syntax and modern design principles.
- The interactive parts of the website are using simple css (scss) transforms, keyframes and animations.
- Additionally, the current version of the mail server is based on the Node.js mail server NPM package and running from AWS.
